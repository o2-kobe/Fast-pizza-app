# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

When designing with Tailwind CSS, several key design principles can enhance the overall aesthetic and usability of your web projects. Here are some important ones:

1. Consistency
   Use Consistent Spacing: Utilize Tailwind's spacing utilities (m-, p-, etc.) to maintain uniform margins and paddings across components.
   Color Palette: Stick to a defined color palette to create a cohesive look.
2. Contrast and Readability
   Text and Background Contrast: Ensure text is easily readable against its background by using light text on dark backgrounds and vice versa.
   Hierarchy: Use different font sizes and weights to establish a clear visual hierarchy.
3. Responsive Design
   Mobile-First Approach: Design for smaller screens first and use responsive utilities (sm:, md:, lg:, etc.) to adapt styles for larger screens.
   Flexible Layouts: Utilize Flexbox and Grid utilities for adaptable layouts.
4. Utility-First Approach
   Compose with Utilities: Build components using Tailwind's utility classes instead of writing custom CSS, promoting reusability and reducing specificity issues.
   Avoid Overly Specific Classes: Keep class names simple and avoid deep nesting to maintain clarity.
5. Accessibility
   Semantic HTML: Use appropriate HTML elements (e.g., <header>, <nav>, <main>, <footer>) to enhance accessibility.
   Focus States: Ensure that interactive elements have visible focus states for keyboard navigation.
6. Whitespace and Layout
   Use Whitespace Strategically: Ensure adequate spacing between elements to prevent a cluttered appearance.
   Grid and Flexbox Layouts: Use Tailwindâ€™s grid and flex utilities to create organized and visually appealing layouts.
7. Visual Feedback
   Hover and Active States: Provide visual feedback for interactive elements using hover and active classes (e.g., hover:bg-blue-500).
   Transitions: Use transition utilities to create smooth animations and interactions.
8. Componentization
   Reusable Components: Break down your UI into reusable components, using Tailwind classes for styling.
   Maintainable Code: Keep your HTML clean and maintainable by grouping related classes and using Tailwind's @apply directive in custom CSS files when necessary.
9. Dark Mode Support
   Dark Mode Utilities: Utilize Tailwind's dark mode feature to provide a dark theme option, enhancing usability in low-light environments.
10. Customizability
    Tailwind Config: Customize your Tailwind configuration file to define your own colors, spacing, and other utilities to align with your design system.
